My name is Kesna Lawrence a/k/a **The Chief Data Scientist**. I love data, technology, business, food, and tropical fish. I am an entrepruner and marketing expert who has a track record of helping investors create enterprise value at the intersection of data, technology, and marketing. 

My Data Science philosophy is based on practicality. There are several resources where people discuss the theory and technicals about the application of data science. I like the focus on the practical aspect of data science.
